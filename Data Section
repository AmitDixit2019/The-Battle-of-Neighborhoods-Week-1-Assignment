Projects – The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1) Assignment:

Data Section:
The city of San Francisco has maintained a large data repository hosted on the website DataSF. From there,

So let’s proceed and see what insight can be extracted from the data. We will be working with two datasets: 
  Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present and 
  San Francisco Historical Secured Property Tax Rolls 2007–2015.
